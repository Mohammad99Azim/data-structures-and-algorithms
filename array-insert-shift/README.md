## Approach & Efficiency
What approach did you take? 

less complexty no loop

and shrink the code as possible i can

Discuss Why. What is the Big O space/time for this approach?

Time -> Big(1) instant time because there is no loop or any thing will increase the complexity

Space -> Big(1) instant space because there is no loop or any thing will increase the space complexity
